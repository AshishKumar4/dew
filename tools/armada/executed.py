"""A pytest plugin that records, for each test file a task runs, the checkout's Python files its tests
executed, for the test cache (`ci.py`): a file whose recorded files are unchanged since it ran green
is not run again.

It counts a file once per test file through sys.monitoring's function-start event, disabled after
the first and restarted at each test file, so it costs about nothing. What collection and
session-scoped fixtures execute serves every test file after them, so it joins every file's record.
A test file that starts another process runs code no event sees, so its record says so, and the
cache never skips it.

It also records where each test file's run read the backend (`reads_backend`) and which of its tests
are marked to run on a GPU (`MARKS`): a file with either takes another path on a GPU, so the H100 tier
runs it (`ci.py gpu-tier`), each file in a process of its own, which records its peak memory on the
GPU (`gpu_peak`). A read is the test file's being collected or run. As with the files they
execute, what session-scoped fixtures read is every file's, and what runs under a module's body,
which runs once, as it is imported, is its own test file's too, and every file's before collection."""
