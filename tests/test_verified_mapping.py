"""Tier 2 of loading: an unregistered model_type through a registered family's verified convention.

The offline cases write a tiny random checkpoint of a transformers class Dew
registers no family for and load it with `Pretrained.load`. CWM is the
Llama block with per-layer sliding windows and a llama3 rope ramp, so it
loads, and its logits match transformers at the tier-1 fixtures' 1e-4
(tests/test_hf_decoders.py).
Granite scales its embeddings, residuals, attention and logits by config
fields the convention does not read. SmolLM3 drops the rotary on every fourth
layer, which a probe shrunk to two layers would never reach.

The network cases load real repos pinned to a commit. No unregistered type in
the top-200 census computes the Llama convention, so each census repo below
is refused, for its own reason, before its weights download. The one real
repo that loads is a random-weight CWM (Meta's Code World Model is the Llama
block with per-layer sliding windows); its released 32B checkpoint passes the
same probe from its config, at 65 GB beyond what this suite downloads. Over
every registered family, `tools/hf_coverage.py` on the 400 most downloaded
text-generation repos (2026-10-05) finds one more type that loads:
GLM-4.7-Flash, as kimi_k2, which the offline GLM_FLASH case checks.
Measured on CPU against transformers 5.16.1 in fp32, over two rows of 64
random ids:

                             max |Δlogits|   bound (twice the measured)
  Dew fp32                   2.09e-07        4.2e-07
  Dew bfloat16 compute and
  storage                    4.02e-03        8.1e-03

on logits of magnitude 0.59.
