"""What a model can be asked for, as structural protocols.

An objective, a task or a server reads a model through these capabilities
instead of asking which class it is. A model has a capability by defining
the method; there is no Dew base class to inherit and no wrapper around a
model. A caller checks one with `isinstance(model, Logits)` and calls it
through Flax's own `apply`, with `rngs` and `mutable` passed to `apply`:

    logits = model.apply(variables, tokens, method='logits')
    states = model.apply(variables, tokens, train=True, method='hidden_states',
                         rngs={'dropout': key})
    table = model.apply(variables, method='output_table')

`Logits` and `HiddenStates` are token models' full-sequence reads, with no
cache: a call writes no `cache` collection, and `Ordered` says whether those
states attend causally. `DenoisingModel` is the call every image and video
denoiser already has, the raw network that `dew.diffusion.process.Denoiser`
wraps into a prediction a solver steps with. `AffineHead` and
`LogitsFromHidden` let a loss score the vocabulary without a second trunk
pass: `output_table` gives the matrix a tiled loss contracts in place of the
logits, and `logits_from_hidden` is the exact head for a head no matrix alone
gives. `HardVocabularyEmbedder` is a media embedder's: the range of the text
vocabulary it embeds itself.
`DenoisingModel` is an annotation only: every Flax module has a `__call__`, so
an `isinstance` check on it would hold for any model.

The keywords a model takes past its tokens are `ModelKwarg` values:
`ModelInputs.kwargs()` gives a request's token fields and conditioning, and
callers add flags and absent values.
